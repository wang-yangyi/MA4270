# MA4270 Data Modelling and Computation

Project Objective:
- To try the machine learning / data modeling techniques learnt in class to interesting real-world multivariate analysis problems. 
- To fit at least 2 models to dataset and compare the different models and their performance.

Dataset:
- Obtained from Kaggle

Models Used:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- AdaBoost
- Logistic Regression

Project Summary:
In MA4270, we have learnt several classification techniques such as the perceptron algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), AdaBoost and logistic regression etc. These algorithms mainly focus on binary classification and hence in this project, we would explore and compare how good some of these algorithms are in doing binary classification. On top of that, we will be using Random Forest Classifier to see how it fares in this classification problem.
The classification problem we will be solving is to determine whether an email is considered spam or not. We chose this problem as email spam filtering is widely used by email providers to filter out phishing emails and scams. It is also easy to understand which allows us to dive deeper into how these algorithms work on this problem and their effectiveness.
